CyberSecure is an AI-powered network intrusion detection system designed for Security Operations Centers (SOCs). It analyzes network traffic patterns using machine learning to identify malicious activity, provides actionable security recommendations, and maintains a tamper-proof audit trail using blockchain technology.Problem StatementModern SOCs are overwhelmed with network traffic and need automated, intelligent systems to:

✅ Detect intrusions in real-time with high accuracy
✅ Prioritize threats by severity level
✅ Recommend immediate security actions
✅ Maintain compliance-ready audit logs
✅ Explain AI decisions to security analysts
Our SolutionA complete end-to-end system featuring:

Zero False Negatives - 100% intrusion detection rate
Intelligent Severity Scoring - LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk classification
Actionable Recommendations - Specific steps for each threat
Blockchain Logging - Immutable, tamper-proof audit trail
Explainable AI - SHAP-based decision transparency
⚡ Key Features🤖 Machine Learning
